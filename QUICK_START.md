# Quick Start Guide - Clan War Tracker

## For Windows Users (Easiest Method)

### Step 1: Download Files
- Download all files to a folder on your computer
- Make sure you have `clan_war_tracker.py` and `create_executable.bat`

### Step 2: Install Python (if not already installed)
1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.7 or newer
3. **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Step 3: Create Executable
1. Double-click `create_executable.bat`
2. Wait for the process to complete
3. Find `ClanWarTracker.exe` in the new `dist` folder
4. Copy the .exe file wherever you want to use it

### Step 4: Run the Application
- Double-click `ClanWarTracker.exe` to start
- No need for Python after this - the .exe runs independently

## Alternative: Run Directly with Python

If you prefer not to create an executable:

1. Install Python (see Step 2 above)
2. Open Command Prompt in the folder with the files
3. Type: `python clan_war_tracker.py`
4. Press Enter
